The repository contains R codes, jupyter python notebooks and useful data.

The directory "R" contains R codes divided in two directories related to MS and ASD each containing three codes necessary to create the STELLA mapping table and to implement the LDA feature.

The directory "python" contains jupyter notebooks that allow to run STELLA in python. The directory also contains a notebook used to validate the software through F-1 scores. 

The directory data contains all the data needed to run the codes and reproduce the results in the paper.
